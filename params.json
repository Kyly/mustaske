First you need to install python software properties.\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\r\n```\r\nYou can install the node stuff.\r\n```\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\r\n```\r\nNow you should have the most up to date version of node.js. Lets move on to\r\nthe good stuff.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---\r\n1. Clone the repository to your local directory.\r\n  ```\r\n  git clone https://github.com/Kyly/mustaske.git\r\n  ```\r\n2. To install the dependencies run the following.\r\n  ```\r\n  cd mustaske\r\n  npm install\r\n  ```\r\n3. Now you can start the app with.\r\n  ```\r\n  npm start\r\n  ```\r\n Now your up and rolling! Open up your browser and make a room. If you are on\r\n local host go to `localhost:3000`.\r\n\r\nFAQS\r\n---\r\n+ _Why are the top question on my computer different then the ones on my\r\nnaighbors?_ Due to server badwidth _top questions_, although correctly accounted on the\r\nbackend, are not guaranteed to be the same on all displays. We call\r\n_Near Real Time_ updates. Over a given period of time polls across all desktops.\r\n\r\n+ Why do I have to use a room ID and not room name? The room ids are your rooms\r\nunique identifier. These are required because more\r\none user might want \"Joes Meat Shack\" and well that's fine, who are we to judge.\r\nSo name your room whatever you like and it will show up in the sites topbar but\r\nto join the room you will need to use the unique room id.\r\n\r\nDebugging\r\n-----\r\nTo set the log level for socket.io you can run the app with:\r\n```\r\n  DEBUG=* npm start\r\n```\r\nThis allows you to see fine grain what request and responses the server is making\r\nalong with details about things like who is in a room.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n-----\r\n### Front end tests with Selenium and Python ###\r\nTo run frontend test you will need to have selenium, pyhton selenium webdriver,\r\nand Firefox browser.\r\n\r\n+ [Download Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/).\r\n+ To install python selenium webdriver on linux run `pip install selenium` for\r\n more information see [selenium python](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).\r\n\r\nThen run the following script:\r\n```\r\n  npm run-script test-front\r\n```\r\nIf this is your first time running the script you will need to make it executable\r\nby entering the following:\r\n```\r\n  sudo chmod +x test/runscripts.sh\r\n```\r\nAdd your own python selenium tests to `test/selenium_src/` directory.\r\n### Server side tests with Mocha ###\r\n\r\nFirst you will need to download mocha to your workstation.\r\n```\r\n  sudo npm install -g mocha\r\n```\r\nNotice we are using ```-g``` which global installs _mocha_ on you workstation.\r\n\r\nThen to run the test simply enter the following from the projects root directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  npm run-script test-back\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou see something like:\r\n```\r\n> supapp@0.0.0 test /home/kyly/GDrive/sp15/cse110/supapp\r\n> mocha ./test/*.js\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rooms\r\n    #addRoom()\r\n      ✓ should have room in questionrepo after addRoom is called.\r\n    #hasRoom()\r\n      ✓ should have room in questionrepo after addRoom is called.\r\n    #purgeRoom()\r\n      ✓ should have room in questionrepo after addRoom is called.\r\n\r\n\r\n  3 passing (5ms)\r\n```\r\nAdd your test to the *test* directory. If you need an example of how these\r\nshould look check out the test in ```roomstest.js```. We have a lot more\r\nassertion available to us so look up the documentation if you want to do\r\nsomething more complex.\r\n\r\n### Run all test ###\r\nTo run all tests simply run:\r\n```\r\n  npm test\r\n```\r\nYou will need to have _all dependencies installed_. For instruction follow the\r\ninstallation instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Story\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The MIT License (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Kyly Vass, Brandon Falk, Tanner Turner, Crystal Kwok,\r\nDaniel Lee, Jose Valdez, Chris Tetreault, Nick Gibson, Robert Kronebusch.\r\n\r\n[See license details here.](LICENSE.md)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
